set timeout for connection in dnsserver.py(where dnsserver.py acts as a client). Figure out how to query for ports other than 53 or 12000(maybe will have to query from mynslookup.py directly to some server other than dnsserver.py using the entered port number)
query to server set by user(other than the default)
